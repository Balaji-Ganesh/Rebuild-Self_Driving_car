## Purpose..
- :idea: 
    - If any object detection mechanism worked on, doesn't suit the needs of RPi computation, this works like a backup -- as traffic signs used are of different shape (and area), so can use that.
    - also planning for.. if the distance measurement doesn't work properly, by this, area of traffic lights can be calculated ... as.
        - as the car moves near to the traffic light, its area on frame increases
    
: Update after experiment..
- it appears, that, this is very susceptible to the light conditions and need tweaking of parameters based on light conditions -- which is infeasible at real-time.
